# Migration
Manages blocks of code that need to run once on version updates in iOS apps. This could be anything from data normalization routines, "What's New In This Version" screens, or bug fixes.
This is the Swift version of [MTMigration][1].
## Install
### Carthage
Not support yet:)
### Simple
Drag and drop the Migration project into your project or simply use Migration.swift in your project.
## Usage
Still working...
You can see the comments in code first.
## Notes
Migration assumes version numbers are incremented in a logical way, i.e. 1.0.1 -\> 1.0.2, 1.1 -\> 1.2, etc.
## License
Migration is released under the [MIT License][2].
